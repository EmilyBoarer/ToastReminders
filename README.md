Use this program to prompt you about timings of lessons.
If you want you can change the timings and messages in the "times" file, or even add your own ones

HOW TO INSTALL:
download ToastRemindersDist.zip
extract to a folder (wherever you want for example C:/ToastReminders)
run the ToastReminder.exe file once when the computer is first booted from shutdown or after a restart

It will prompt with these reminders only on weekdays

It is (by default) configured with the BMDS timetable
